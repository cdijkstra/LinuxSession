  * Finish assignments
    * 5 Modules that take ~10 minutes to finish including my solutions.
    * Flags; Maybe combine with other topic like basic command usage?
    * Redirection; Use 2>&1 and <
    * Permissions;
      * Directories under other user. That's why no files can be placed there.

    * Add hints
* Finish slides
  * Use feedback forms in first slides
  * Add content on command chaining
  * Permissions, users and groups
