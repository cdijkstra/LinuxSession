What to Do:

* Finish assignments (4 hours)
  * Add hints
  * 5 - 6 Modules that take ~10 minutes to finish including my solutions.
* Add pictures and links to slides (e.g. different Desktop environments)



Ideas Linux

- Aliases. Share common ones and create one to generate secure SSH password
- Install package (`mlocate`) and find where application is located





Nice to have:

* Install markdown previewer (like pip install grip) in Dockerfile and mention that this can be used
