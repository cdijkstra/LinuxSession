There is an executable script called script.sh.
1. Output all content to output.txt
2. Output stdout into stdout.txt
3. Output stderr into stderr.txt
4. Repeat 2 but ensure that stdout is not printed on screen
5. Output stdout to mixed.txt and append stderr to it using a single command (containing &&).
